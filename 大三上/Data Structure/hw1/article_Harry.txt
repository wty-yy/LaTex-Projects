Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly
out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under
his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on.
Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs
was full of them, and that was where he slept.
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The
table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It
looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not
to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why
Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was
very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved
punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but
he couldn't often catch him.
